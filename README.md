"Login Page" 
A Simple Page made using html,css and javascript for RBAC (Role based access authorization) and authentication practice and implemention 


Uses PHP with built-in MySQL setup usimg XAMPP ,as the database.

Functions:
1.Allows a person to Login to their existing account by entering email and password.

2.Navigated to Admin or User page depending on their role.

3.If the password or email entered is wrong  then the access is denied.Authorization technique comes into play here and data is cross-checked to allow authorization and access.

4.If the user doesn't have an account then they can choose the register option 


5. In the Register window, they can enter name, email , set password and choose their role(admin or user).Later it would navigate them to respective pages.


FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
Can suggest user to create a stronger password and also provide user ID automatically for better safety. Will implement that and entering puzzles for checking robots soon.
